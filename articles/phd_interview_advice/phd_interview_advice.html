                <h1>Tips For PhD Interviews</h1>

                    It’s that time of year again…interview season. The interview process for biomedical graduate
                    programs can be a nerve-wracking experience. What I have learned from personally going through the
                    process myself as well as getting advice from my peers and more senior graduate students is that
                    preparation is very important to achieve success. In this post, I will lay out the most helpful
                    advice I've received on how you can best prepare for your interviews.    
                </p>

            <section class="post-section">
                <p>
                    For many programs, you may not know who you are going to be interviewing with until a couple days
                    before, so it’s important to use that short amount of time to learn about your assigned faculty and
                    their research. But before that, you have ample time to spend
                    preparing answers for questions about yourself.

            <section class="post-section">
                <p>
                    To prepare, I would recommend reviewing your education, research experience, and personal qualities
                    that graduate programs look for. The way I prepared was by creating a study guide on myself and
                    making sure I could talk about everything on there at length.

                <p>
                    It may seem silly to review information about yourself, but if you practice your answers to the
                    typically asked questions before the interview day, you will be much more comfortable and able to
                    speak with confidence during the actual interview. Practicing beforehand also allows you to identify parts 
                    of your CV that you may think you can explain well, until you actually try and it doesn’t come out as clear 
                    as you thought it would. Preparing like this helps you to iron out the details and have concise and clear explanations.

                    <br><b>DO NOT</b> attempt to memorize the words you will say, but focus on the message and intention of your
                    answers.

                    Listed below are prompts I used to prepare myself for successful interviews. These are compiled from
                    multiple online or personal sources and helped me feel confident going into my interviews.
                </p>

            <section class="post-section">
                <p>
                    <h5>So, tell me about yourself.</h5>

                    This is an extremely open-ended prompt and it’s usually intentionally that way. This is the faculty
                    member giving you an opportunity to share your personal story. For this answer, I would recommend a
                    short, somewhat personal backstory about where you come from then outline your education and
                    research trajectory. You can additionally add some information about what you like to do for fun if
                    you’re comfortable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Can you tell me about [insert research project from your CV]?</h5>
                    To prepare for these kinds of questions. I wrote out a summary for each one of my research projects on my CV with a strong focus on the significance of the work. 
                    This gives you the chance to show that you have specific research experience and are able to connect it to the field as a whole.

                    <h5>Why do you want to get a PhD?</h5>
                    
                    The answer to this question is clearly very personal and varies a lot. To have a good answer, I
                    recommend really taking some time to reflect on how a PhD aligns with your life goals. Responding
                    with, “I want a higher degree so I can make more money”, usually is not a good answer (even if it’s
                    true).

                    <h5>Why do you want to attend [school]?</h5>

                    This is one of the questions that changes depending on the program you're interviewing with. This
                    question is to see if you are a good fit for the program and if you have done your homework. You
                    should be able to list some program specific qualities that led you to apply to this program. Some
                    examples include, highly translational research, multiple labs with strong research interest
                    overlap, located near my family, etc.

                    <h5>What kind of research do you want to do?</h5>

                    This question is also very personal and largely up to you. It may be a good idea to put more
                    emphasis on your research interests that align with the program so you feel like a stronger fit.

                <p>
                    <h5>What are your personal strengths/weaknesses?</h5>

                    A good opportunity to display both humility and self-awareness. Be honest with yourself about your
                    strengths and weaknesses. Don’t brag about your strengths and similarly don’t tear yourself down
                    with your weaknesses.

                <p>
                    <h5>What are your post-PhD plans?</h5>

                    This question can be used to show that you have long term goals and are very forward thinking. You
                    are obviously not beholden to the plans that you respond with but it is good to decide on a set plan
                    just for the interviews. This displays that you have put a lot of thought into your academic
                    decisions and have a strong focus on long term goals.

                <p>
                    <h5>Could you tell me about a challenge or setback you overcame?</h5>

                    This question gives you an opportunity to display that you are the type of person who can deal with
                    challenges. Clearly conveying that you have these qualities is important because perseverance is
                    arguably the most important trait in a graduate student. You will spend a lot of time dealing with
                    <a href="../embracing_failure/embracing_failure.html">failure</a> during a PhD, so giving direct evidence that you can deal with this really strengthens
                    yourself as a candidate.

                    <h5>How do you deal with stress/failure/conflict?</h5>

                    Do you have a cool head under pressure? Can you self-regulate? Are you aware of what mental health resources best
                    fit you as an individual? These are good sub questions to ponder so you can show that you have a tried
                    and true method to deal with the inevitable stress of graduate school.

                    I then wrote out questions that I wanted to ask the faculty or students already in the program. These questions usually were to show your
                    curiosity or find out more about the environment of the program.

                <!-- <h2>Conclusion</h2> -->
                <p>
                    Once I had these fleshed out, I practiced answering them by myself or with my friends. There are
                    also many videos and articles online to help you prepare. Here are some videos that I found to be
                    useful:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t51IEfiSMg">PhD Interview Questions | What do PhD supervisors look for in applicants?</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hts6YUIfQc&t=4s">PhD Interview Questions + Answers | How To Pass Your PhD Interview</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UShAqoCM6FA">PhD interview questions and answers - the model answers and secret ingredient!</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    Besides the advice above, I would say to just be yourself. Most faculty are really nice and the
                    interviews are typically just a conversation where they want to get to know you. Also, a lot of the
                    time, faculty actively try to convince you to choose their program. Also, remember to not
                    compare yourself to the other applicants, as you are on your own individual journey. A good thing to
                    keep in mind is to remember that if you are interviewing at a graduate program then you are there
                    for a reason and deserve to be there. Good luck!
