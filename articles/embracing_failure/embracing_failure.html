                    I recently experienced a stark reminder of the research process and the importance of embracing failure.

                    I was working on a computational analysis for one of my research projects that I just couldn’t seem to get right. Each time I thought I was approaching it correctly, it quickly became clear that something was off.

                    At first, I felt frustrated with myself for needing so many attempts. However, after some reflection, I realized that upon each iteration, the analysis improved. In fact, these failures were entirely necessary for the analysis to reach its current form. Each mistake taught me something new and helped me improve my approach. Along with a more robust analysis, my awareness of issues in my own work improved. Experiencing these failures now will make me more efficient and accurate the next time I tackle a similar problem.

                    Stepping back and analyzing your work helps you see what went wrong. Reframing failure in this manner is powerful. Making this a reflex will help you grow.

                    I’ve read countless articles and listened to podcasts about growth mindset. It’s still not my first reaction, but I am moving in that direction.

                    If this resonates with you, let it be a reminder to embrace failure and reflect on what specifically went wrong. These lessons are invaluable for growth and can strengthen your approach in the future.
